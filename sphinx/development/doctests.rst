Doctests guide
==============

(Work in progress)

Doctests are generated by recursing the source files and looking for comment lines starting with ``>>>``.
The text following ``>>>`` is interpreted as a command. The lines following ``>>>`` are interpreted as the test expected output,
when run in the command line.

Expected test output ends

1) when the next line is no longer a comment line
2) when another comment line starts with ``>>>``
3) when two blank comment lines are provided

In expected test output, blank lines are ignored. Errors are not captured, and will crash the test handler.

Test files are written in the MoXUnit format, using functions and subfunctions as the
rest of the RepLAB test suite; the helper function ``assertEqualEvalcOutput`` is used
to verify the test output.

Our inspiration for the above comes from `<http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#writing-testable-examples>`_.
